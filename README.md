> Using Graph Protocol as database to listen to events instead of Moralis Database otherwise everything is same as moralis-frontend repo.

# Project Overview

First thing we've do is before starting anything, deploy our NFT-Marketplace-Contract on testnet.

Instead of reading the events from Moralis server, we will:
  1. Index them with TheGraph
  2. Read from the Graph

# Indexing Events on TheGraph or Subgraph

1. Go to Subgraph Studio on TheGraph protocol Website.
